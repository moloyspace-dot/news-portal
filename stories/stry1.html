   <body>
      <p>Simple life with education and work. I am at here and I try to stay here. Good communicatin with eye mouth hear 
         touch. But what happen suddenly often? Some peoples mind though came to my mind. Thouh in reality I didn't get
         their touch at all but I only believed a girl's mind whom I love. Because she is excelent and understood this
         problem. So she try to inform me through social media that what I get in mind about her is right. Whatever, this
         was a luck because I got this time of thing many times in my life. But most of the people did other what they said
         during communication with me. During normal time I try to trust that, this is my brain problem. Slowly I knew this is a common problem of everyone.
         Whatever slowly its area goes long. I get like some some special people stay around us and the world is distroyed.
         It's the time they will come and the progress of repair the real world will begin again with joy. But sad. Voice comes in mind
         suddenly goes and also I think that they were not there. So I feel sad. Bucause I see that I stoped my educatin because 
         of this voice. And without education there is no money in my real life system. It made me sad. But slowly I think
         that, 'because of everything can happen, my normal life or society system is also not fake'. This education is also
         necessary to repair this world. But I see that no one like this, maybe they are lezy. Whatever the girl is so nice. I don't
         know she try to find another one to make my life friend as I had to believe in mind before when different voices in 
         mind disturbed me. But whatever I hope that, this bridge between mind and reality which she started to buid will finish nicely.
         It's really a luck.

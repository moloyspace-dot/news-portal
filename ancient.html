         <h1>Powers of Ancient Period</h1>
         <img src="photos/victory.png" id="v9" width="185px">
         <p>In the ancient period there are too many powers in the nature. There are about 53 or more who are always respectable to anyone.
            But with the end they become disappeared from the nature. There are too many reasons. One of it is trying to separate the people based
            on their religion or belief. Because from the start of this universe there are seen many and many lost people and sometimes these people come back with a different
            look and with different behaviour too. So it is always difficult to find them easily. According to these powers, this universe is as always. Everyone
            is always human with legs, hands, head, body, ears, eyes, nose, hair etc. They can remember one day this universe was too beautiful. Everyone were living
            with peace. Someone popular has more than two wives he was also with each other with his wives but in separate room. If you think you can remember the song
            of that time "Ogo bideshini, tumi kokhono amake por koroni..... tumi je amar ; ogo tumi je amar". By the way these powers are always
            respectful and always people needs them. So it should be prayable that they can start their starting from the current time at here with active
            and alive humans. Everyone will be happy with a support and hope.

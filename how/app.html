         <h1 id="src">How computer application works.</h1>
         <div id="hdr">
            <p>You use computer, smart phone, normal phone everywhere you see some apps. App is basically some lines of instructions.
               When these instructions works then it is called 'run'. Actually applications run on the RAM. (During buying phone or
               computer you see this. 8GB Ram or 4GB Ram. Ram is a kind of memory. Normally applications are combined of some pages
               of code which you keep in your device's normal memory. Menas when it is installed it takes your phone's normal storage to stay silently.
               But when it runs? Then it uses RAM. Means those pages of codes use RAM to work. That's why low RAM's computer or phone
               often goes hang. Because some of applications always work behind the screen means though you do not use. These are like
               message, call etc apps. You get the call instantly when someone call you. On the other hand think about a call on messenger
               which you can get after an hour when you open your messenger app again, someone called when this application was closed.
               Some of the applications or most of the modern applications use internet. Normally internet is just a connection. When you
               open your gallery app, you can see photos. Because your device's memory card stores this. But when you open facebook then a
               photo you see... it comes from other storage which is so far from you at any other city or other computer. Broadly internet
               is so many connections with a large area. From one storage so meny people can request to see a photo.<br/><br/>
               Now deeply how a social app (like Facebook/ instagram/ twitter works):-
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <b>Server</b>- You want to open a page on facebook? Your facebook app request it to the server to get the code/ images/ audio or
                     any other types of data (kept in any storage). After it coming via the internet your app show this on the screen. Again when you upload your profile picture
                     then it requests to the server to keep your data (at any storage). So mainly handle user related communication server works. Devices
                     are identified uniquely by its IP address and other mechanisms. And for a large amount of the storage you can hear the name of <b>Datacenter</b>.
                  </li> <br/>
                  <li>
                     <b>Database</b>- It is that storage which keeps your data nicely and organisely (actually your data in a file which is kept in that storage).<br/><br/>
                     Suppose that this is a text file in which datas are kept a shape of database:
                     <pre class="slp"><code>
                        moloy:
                        {
                           "image":"picName.jpg",
                           "name":"Moloy Ghosh",
                           "desception":"I like my computer more than to eat",
                           "posts":
                              {
                                 "id":"001",
                                 "text":"Seriously there was a problem in this universe to keep control the mad people"
                              },
                              {
                                 "id":"006",
                                 "text":"Nowadays it is really a matter of laugh that whatever you learn is not necessery after your death"
                              }

                        }
                     </code></pre>
                     <i>Also you can keep as table style or so on.</i>
                  </li> <br/>
                  <li>
                     <b>Backend</b>- It is made with so many lines of code. code is actually nothing but instruction. There are some instructions...
                     a computer or a device knows.<br/><br/>
                     these are like:-
                     <pre class="slp"><code>
                        <span>
                        print: "Hellow world";
                        </span>
                       <span>
                        if (user types "ok"):
                           {print: "I am honest"}
                        else of anything:
                           {print: "I am not honest"}
                        </span>
                        <span>
                        loop(from 1 to 199):
                        {
                           print: "I love Bangladesh";
                        }
                        </span>
                     </code></pre>
                     <i>Here between inverted commas, user can write anything. But others are keywords of the code. Accoring to these keywords for the
                        fist one, it prints on the computer screen <u>Hellow World</u>. For the third part it will print on the computer screen <U>I love
                           Bangladesh.</U> 199 times. Means you will see 199 lines of same sentence on your screen. You can change the value of number as you wish  </i>
                     For more... functions, some systems of showing data etc are all about the code. You are to know logics to use these kind of code differently and
                     to do many kind of calculations of complex demanded application. And more complex logics using these instruction you can create different
                     models which called Machine Learning.<br/><br/>
                     Suppose another code:
                     <pre class="slp"><code>
                        function jogKoro(a,b){
                           c= a+b;
                        }

                        print: {c};
                     </code></pre>
                     <i>Here any user any give any two numbers. which will set as 'a' and 'b'. And at last user will see the value of
                        'c' on the screen which is actually a function. here 'jogKoro' is function name.</i><br/><br/>
                     For showing the database's value:-
                     <pre class="slp"><code>
                     print: {moloy.description}
                     </code></pre>
                     <i>This will show the sentense <u>I like my computer more than to eat</u>. (See that here I did not use inverted commas).</i>
                     
                  </li><br/>
                  <li>
                     <b>Frontend</b>- Here is the code of how to show your code on the page. like:-
                     <pre class="slp"><code>
                        &lt;circle&gt; print: {moloy.image} &lt;/circle&gt;
                        &lt;rectangle&gt; print:{moloy.name} &lt;/rectangle&gt;
                        &lt;line&gt; print:{moloy.description} &lt;/line&gt;
                     </code>
                     </pre>
                     <i>think these codes will give a shape on the screen as something like facebook when you will visit my profile, getting data through server.</i><br/><br/>
                     for color:-
                     <pre class="slp"><code>
                        &lt;circle "collor:yellow;"&gt; print: {moloy.image} &lt;/circle&gt;
                     </code></pre>
                  </li>
               </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
               Always we think to find something new to develop. So for other features you can think cache memory of your application. Through
               internet which pages you see frequently your app keep these on cache memory (you can think it as normal memory). Because it is
               better to bring the same things from other storage kept so far somewhere.

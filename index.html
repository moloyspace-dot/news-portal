         <p>The thing is that Sex is open for everyone. But one day it creates a problem that it can create pressure on mind. So it should be in control. One day it is
            proved that, sex is necessary to give relief the souls of this destroyed world. Because the souls were too old. So for a long time living,
            it was in their mind that what is sex? Man Woman relationship? It is also seen as common that two different family's man and woman without
            any connection they became friends. Their husbend was happy that they got a new person as support as everyone believed that this world is
            really outrageous. After some days it is seen that this world is going to be destroyed because of the fear of some unknown questions. So sex is
            one of them. People are still there with a strong negative force to come in present time because there gathered the so so little particle of
            thoughts that without knowing some questions we cannot move. Othewise problem will be too massive. Nowadays it is seen that boys get angry when
            their wife or mother goes to sex with other man. That is because of the gathered passured in their mind that if other man do any harm of their
            family if any other man get a chance using poor brain of woman whereas they don't go outside much or from the thinking of their heart is
            so limp as they are the order of mother or they are good form home works. So coming so far after destroyed this world now it is time to after
            getting well from mentally and physically we have to be prepared about sex with an open mind. (References: GSM daily news, Norway Line, COMMA Portal etc.)
